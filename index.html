            <h2 class="section-title">Data Source</h2>
            <p>The data used in this visualization comes from the World Bank, which tracks GDP annual growth rates for countries globally. The dataset includes annual GDP growth information for each of the top 10 economies from 2000 to 2020.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">GDP Annual Growth</h2>
            <p>GDP annual growth represents the percentage change in the country's gross domestic product each year. This percentage gives an understanding of economic health and growth trends of a country over time. Higher growth rates can indicate a healthy and growing economy, while negative growth may suggest a recession or economic contractions due to wide variety of factors.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Write-Up</h2>
            <p> This chart was designed, as is, in order to allow viewers to choose which of the top countries by gdp to compare as well as which year they would like to view.  Each country is seperated by color on the chart to help viewers see which country is which.  There is also a legend that has a checkbox next to each country to allow viewers to add or remove countries from the chart to be able to compare specific countries if they choose.  An alternative of this chart that was considered was using a larger time frame than 2000-2020.  This was kept to 2000-2020 due to the fact that the technology and economies of each country have changed so much in the last century that the most recent 20 years is probably a much closer representation to how these countries will change in the future.  Another alternative that was considered was using a bar chart and a drop down menu to allow viewers to change the year but this line graph felt like it showed a better side by side comparison and also allowed for comparing specific countries side by side on the same chart.  </p>
            <p> This page took around 8 total people-hours to complete.  The aspects that took the most time were deciding on which tools to incorporate into the chart and troubleshooting any issues with the codes that were used for each page in visual studio.</p>
